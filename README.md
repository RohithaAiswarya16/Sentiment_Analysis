# Sentiment_Analysis
## Project Name: Sentiment Analysis
* DataSet: The dataset is included with the files uploaded `twitter_training.csv` and `twitter_validation.csv`
* This project was completed as part of my internship at Code Clause, where I had the fantastic opportunity to explore the field of sentiment analysis and its application on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
### Overview
* The primary objective of this project was to build a simple yet effective sentiment analysis model that could classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By analyzing public tweets, I aimed to gain insights into the overall sentiment of users on various topics.
### Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
